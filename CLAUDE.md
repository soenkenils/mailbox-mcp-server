# CLAUDE.md

## Style
- ES modules, destructured imports, double quotes, 2 spaces, semicolons
- Arrow functions, async/await, object/array destructuring

## Commands
- `bun dev` - development server
- `bun test` - run tests (using vitest)
- `bun run test:watch` - run tests in watch mode
- `bun run test:coverage` - run tests with coverage
- `bun run check` - lint and format
- `bun run test:imap` - IMAP integration test

## Workflow
- Try to use a TDD approach first
- Run tests and formatting after code changes
- Use single tests for performance
