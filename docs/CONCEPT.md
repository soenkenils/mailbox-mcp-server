# Technical Concept: Local MCP Server for mailbox.org Integration

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical architecture and implementation approach for a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates mailbox.org email and calendar services with Anthropic's Claude Desktop application. The solution provides secure, local access to personal email and calendar data through a locally-hosted Node.js server that communicates with Claude Desktop via the MCP protocol.

## Introduction: Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Local Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is Anthropic's open standard for securely connecting AI systems with external data sources. MCP servers are typically executed as local processes that communicate with Claude Desktop through stdio (Standard Input/Output) or other IPC mechanisms.

A local MCP server provides direct, secure access to personal data without cloud dependencies. The server runs as a standalone Node.js process on the local system and is automatically started and managed by Claude Desktop.

**Communication Flow**:

```
Claude Desktop ←→ MCP Server (stdio) ←→ mailbox.org (IMAP/CalDAV/CardDAV)
```

## System Architecture and Data Sources

### mailbox.org Protocol Integration

#### Email Access via IMAP

**Connection Parameters**:

- **Server**: imap.mailbox.org:993 (IMAP)
- **Authentication**: App-specific passwords recommended
- **Core Features**: Basic IMAP operations for reading and searching emails

#### Calendar Access via CalDAV

**CalDAV Integration**:

- **Base URL**: <https://dav.mailbox.org/>
- **Standard**: RFC 4791 CalDAV compliance
- **Operations**: Read calendar events, create/update events

### Local Data Processing and Session Caching

#### Simple Session Caching

**Temporary in-memory storage** to avoid redundant API calls:

- Email searches cached for 5 minutes
- Calendar events cached for 15 minutes  
- Contacts cached for 30 minutes
- Cache clears completely on application restart

#### Direct API Philosophy

**Always fetch fresh data** from mailbox.org:

- No persistent database required
- No synchronization complexity
- Current data guaranteed
- Privacy-first approach (no local storage)

#### Credential Management

**Current Implementation (Simple local storage)**:

- Environment variables for credentials
- App-specific passwords for mailbox.org

## MCP Server Implementation

### Core Server Architecture

#### Server Initialization and Lifecycle

```typescript
class MailboxMcpServer {
  private server: Server;
  private services: {
    email: EmailService;
    calendar: CalendarService;
    contacts: ContactService;
  };
  private cache: LocalCache;
  private config: ServerConfig;

  constructor() {
    this.initializeServer();
    this.initializeServices();
    this.setupToolHandlers();
    this.setupResourceHandlers();
  }
}
```

#### Tool Definition and Schema Validation

**Email Tools (Current Implementation Status)**:

- `search_emails`: Full-text search with folder filter and time range limitation
- `get_email`: Complete email content with attachment references
- `get_email_thread`: Conversation threading with chronological sorting

**Calendar Tools (Current Implementation Status)**:

- `get_calendar_events`: Time-based event queries with recurrence resolution
- `search_calendar`: Full-text search in event titles, descriptions, and locations
- `get_free_busy`: Availability analysis for appointment scheduling

### Service Implementation

#### Email Service

**Direct IMAP access** with basic caching:

- Check session cache first
- Perform IMAP search if cache miss
- Cache results for 5 minutes
- Support for basic folder operations

#### Calendar Service  

**CalDAV integration** for calendar access:

- Direct CalDAV queries for events
- Basic recurrence rule handling
- Session caching for 15 minutes
- Multi-calendar support

### Error Handling and Resilience

#### Simple Error Strategies

**Network Issues**:

- Automatic reconnection with basic retry logic
- Fallback to cached data when available
- Clear error messages for users

**Authentication Problems**:

- Credential refresh workflows
- Graceful degradation to read-only mode
- User-friendly error reporting

## Performance and Scalability

### Simple Performance Approach

#### Memory Management

**Basic session caching**:

- Simple Map-based cache with TTL
- Automatic cleanup on restart
- Size limits to prevent memory issues

#### Connection Efficiency

**Smart API usage**:

- Connection pooling for IMAP/CalDAV
- Cache to reduce redundant requests
- Basic rate limiting protection

### Scaling Considerations

**For larger datasets**:

- Paginated email loading when needed
- Background prefetching for active folders
- Simple multi-account support if required

## Security and Privacy

### Simple Security Model

#### Credential Storage

**Basic secure storage**:

- OS keychain for credentials when available
- Environment variables for development
- No credential transmission to third parties

#### Data Protection

**Privacy-first approach**:

- All processing happens locally
- No persistent data storage
- Session cache only (clears on restart)
- Direct connections to mailbox.org only

#### Network Security

**Standard protections**:

- TLS encryption for all connections
- Certificate validation
- Basic rate limiting to respect mailbox.org limits

## Development and Deployment

### Session Cache Implementation

**Lightweight In-Memory Caching Architecture**:

The session cache provides temporary storage for API responses to improve performance while maintaining data freshness. The cache automatically expires entries based on configurable TTL values and includes cleanup mechanisms to prevent memory leaks.

**Cache Design Principles**:

- **Automatic Expiration**: Entries expire based on data type and update frequency
- **Memory Management**: LRU eviction and size limits prevent unlimited growth
- **Cleanup Automation**: Background processes remove expired entries
- **Cache Invalidation**: Pattern-based invalidation for related data updates
- **Session Scope**: Cache cleared completely on application restart

**Service Integration**:
Each service (Email, Calendar, Contacts) integrates with the session cache using service-specific cache keys and TTL values. The cache provides transparent performance improvements without affecting the real-time nature of data access.

**No Database Dependencies**:

- No schema files, migrations, or database setup required
- No persistent storage configuration or maintenance
- No data synchronization concerns between local and remote data
- Simple deployment with zero external database dependencies
- Automatic cleanup of all cached data on application termination
